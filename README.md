# What is OpenListen?

Openlisten is an Open-Source music listening software (think of it like open-source spotify)

# How do I selfhost it?

You can selfhost it simply by cloning the repository and selfhosting it by using github pages or just by simply serving the files in the root directory! You should be able to access all the music and image files from their folders. 

# How do I add my own music?

This is also very easy, just drag and drop the audio files in the "music" folder, and the album cover in the "img" folder. Then, access script.js and follow the following template in the middle of the file to add music:

            title: "Everybody Wants To Rule The World",
            artist: "Tears For Fears",
            cover: "img/aristocracy-pineapplemusic.webp",
            src: "music/Everybody Wants To Rule The World 4.mp3",
            category: "Pop"

Enjoy!
